# ProWidgets SDK

ProWidgets SDK includes headers and two NIC templates. You are required to use **theos** and prepare the library file in order to compile successfully.

The two NIC templates are for developers to create a basic widget (like Hello World) for ProWidgets.

## Where should I put these files to?

For headers, put the directory `libprowidgets` and the files inside to `THEOS_PATH/include/`.

For NIC templates, put the two `*.nic.tar` files to `THEOS_PATH/templates/iphone/`.

For library file, copy the ProWidgets library `libprowidgets.dylib` from `/Library/ProWidgets/libprowidgets.dylib` on your device to `THEOS_PATH/lib/libprowidgets.dylib` on your computer.

## What should I do next?

Read the documentation and headers to understand the concept about ProWidgets.

More practically, there are some sample widgets available on GitHub for developers to see how a widget is written.
